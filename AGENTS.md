## Rules
- You are only allowed to use `core` and `alloc` ensure imports are adjusted.
- External crates like `getset` are allowed BUT they have to work on no_std too. 
- Try to make stuff that doesnt need to be exposed to the user as private as possible.
- Do not use types that rely on the global allocator. Some no_std environments do not have or never initialize the global allocator. Therby using `Vec` or `Box` might not work unless you explicitly provide it with an allocator.
- Error handling should be possible if the user wants it else `expect` is allowed to be used.
- Be sure to use `assert` in debug builds to give user more insight if they are doing something wrong.
- Unsafe is allowed and probably needed but the final user facing api (except trait implementations) should be as safe as possible.
- Do not comment unless its a `SAFETY` comment.
- Ensure everything manually allocated is free eventually.
- Allocators cannot be copied nor cloned. This is fundamentally wrong. NEVER CLONE ALLOCATORS
